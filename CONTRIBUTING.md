# Contribution guidelines

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this handbook. Any help would be much appreciated.

## How to contribute

Please feel free to improve the quality of this content by submitting **pull requests**. A merged PR will make you appear in the contributor list. It will, however, be considered a donation of your work to this project. You are still bound by the conditions of the license, meaning that you are not considered an author or owner of the content once it has been merged in.

You may also open **issues** for pointing out mistakes or suggesting ideas.

## Support (or lack thereof)

Please do *not* use issues to ask for help. Unfortunately, I don't have enough free time to answer individual requests, so these issues would be closed immediately.

## Markdown flavor

Leanpub uses a specific flavor of Markdown. As much as possible, this book is written using GitHub-Flavored Markdown to improve rendering on GitHub and elsewhere, while staying compatible with Leanpub.

The only exceptions are info, tip, warning and error text boxes defined with `I>`, `T>`, `W>` and `E>` instead of the classic `>` syntax. Read the [Leanpub documentation](https://leanpub.com/help/manual#leanpub-auto-more-text-block-types) for more details.
